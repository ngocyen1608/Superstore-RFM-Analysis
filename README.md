## I. Introduction
### 1. About RFM Analysis
### What is RFM and why does it matter?
RFM is a customer segmentation approach that leverages three key metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
- Recency: When was the customer's last transaction?
- Frequency: How often does the customer make purchases?
- Monetary: What's the total value of the customer's spending?
This method allows businesses to categorize their customer base according to their buying patterns. By examining how recently and how often customers buy, as well as how much they spend, companies can gain valuable insights into customer behavior.
### Implementing RFM
The process involves assigning scores to customers for each of the three dimensions - Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. These scores are then combined to create distinct customer segments, each with its own characteristics and potential strategies.

By employing RFM analysis, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and maximize the value of their customer relationships.
